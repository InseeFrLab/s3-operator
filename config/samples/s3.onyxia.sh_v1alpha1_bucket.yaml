  # Quota values are in bytes
  # TODO : ideally, it could be better to be able to specify the size unit - or at least use one less verbose
  # than "bytes", but the first S3 provider implemented on this operator does not allow this. Or rather, the Minio
  # CLI (mc) does, but the Go client sadly does not, which leaves us with the default unit of "bytes".
  quota:
    default: 10000000    # default value used for quota initial creation
    # override: 20000000 # value overridable by a cluster admin
